        <dd>To understand the meaning of tech stack, let us find out the intent behind creating a web application. <br>
            The application you build should be fast and provide an interactive browsing 
            experience to users. If users seek more information, the application
             must be able to quickly fetch and organize the information in an easy-to-view manner. 
             Further, as your application grows in popularity, it should scale well, without adding 
             any performance overhead to the application ecosystem.</dd>
